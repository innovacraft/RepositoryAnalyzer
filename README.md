# Repository Analyzer

## Overview
The Repository Analyzer is a web application designed to analyze open-source projects on GitHub. It uses the Ollama LLM model ("qwen2.5-coder:14b") to provide a detailed description and analysis of each file within a repository. 
This tool aims to help developers understand codebases quickly, making it easier to contribute to open-source projects or get insights into how various components of a project work together.
